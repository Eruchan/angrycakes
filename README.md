Hello Martin!

I'm really sorry to deliver such an unfinished game but it was quite difficult for me to work with c#, especially when working on our first project at the same time, which is cleary where my focus was this semester. For the next time I will definitely plan in more time for such tasks and not rely on the hope that I will finish it quickly. 
I know there is still much I can learn and that is exactly what I will do.
